# README: TODO: Expand on this, extensively
The goal of this project is to build a compiled implementation of the [JQ programming language]([url](https://github.com/jqlang/jq)https://github.com/jqlang/jq).

Eventually, this project will be ported to C++. This will provide a more accurate
measurement of the compiled versus interpreted implementations.
